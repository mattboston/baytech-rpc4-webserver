# Baytech RPC-4 PDU Webserver

The Baytech RPC-4 (at least the one I have) is an 8 port PDU and you can remotely switch on and off individual ports.  But it has to be managed over a console cable. This project uses a Raspberry Pi, USB to Serial adapter, and a Cisco console cable and gives you a web interface to manage the Baytech RPC-4 PDU.
